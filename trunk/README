Gtk Theme Switch Ex is a small and fast program which allows you to preview 
and switch GTK themes. It is designed to be usable and flexible from both 
the shell prompt and X-Windows display. Please see the manual page or run 
the switch executable with the -help option for information on the allowed 
command line options.

Gtk Theme Switch Ex is based on the Gtk Theme Switch free software 
version 2.0.0.rc2, originally developed by Aaron Lehman and Maher Awamy.
